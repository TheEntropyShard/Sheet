Sheet is a client for the [Shoot](https://github.com/MaddyUnderStars/shoot) messenger

### Quick Start
First make sure that you have at least **JDK 17** installed. Then execute this command to run the client:
```shell
$ ./gradlew runDistributable
```
If you want to build a distributable package for the current OS, run the following:
```shell
$ ./gradlew createDistributable
```
